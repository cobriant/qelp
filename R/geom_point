### geom_point()

#### Description

The geom_point call is an example of aesthetic mapping. It is a geom function used in conjunction with ggplot to display two continuous variables as scatterplots. Geom_point will inherit the data and aesthetic mapping from ggplot, and visa versa, so data only has to be input once.

#### Usage

ggplot(data(aes(x,y)) + geom_point(x,y, alpha, color, fill, shape, size, stroke)

### Arguments

aes()      aesthetic mapping.

data       data frame used for scatterplot; inherited from ggplot.

x          specify which variable should be drawn on the x axis.

y          specify which variable should be drawn on the y axis.

alpha      opacity; written as a fraction ranging from 0 to 1. It an also be combined with color or fill RGB values through "#RRGGBBAA" where AA = alpha value.

color      outer line color of point; can be defined by a variable, color name, or hex code.

fill       color inside of point; can be defined by a variable, color name, or hex code. Only shapes 21 - 24 allow for fill.

shape      the shape of point; can be identified by an integer, name of shape, or a single character.

size       size of point; identified by an integer. The default size is 1.5

stroke     border width of point; identified by integer.

#### examples

ggplot(data = US_data, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point(shape = 23, color="purple", fill="white") +
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy", y = "GDP Per Capita")

ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = species, y = height)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "#33CCFF", fill = "pink", size = 3, stroke = 1)

# you can also layer points to include different identifying variables:

ggplot(data = US_data, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = year), size = 5) +
  geom_point(colour = "grey") +
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy", y = "GDP Per Capita")
