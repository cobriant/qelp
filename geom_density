geom_density()

geom_density is a type of mapping. The geom is used with ggplot to give a pleasing and smoothing view of how different factors in a dataset differ from one another.

ggplot(
  data(aes(x, color, fill) + 
  geom_density(alpha)

aes: aesthetic mapping.
       
data: data used for the density plot.

x: variable chosen for the x-axis.

color: color identifier of different variables or color name.

alpha: opacity of variables, written as a fraction from 0 to 1.

fill: the color inside of the variable.


Examples


library(gapminder)

ggplot(
  data = gapminder, 
  aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent, fill = continent)
) +
  geom_density()

----------------------------------------------------------------

You can also add vertical lines to mark a position in the data plot. geom_vline represents a vertical line and where it needs to intercept on the x-axis

library(gapminder)

ggplot(
  data = gapminder, 
  aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent, fill = continent)
) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 70)
