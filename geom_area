geom_area()

Description

geom_area is a type of plot, using ggplot. It shows the area of each variable by adjusting the settings you can see each individual variale compared to each other.


ggplot(
  data, aes(x, fill)
) +
  geom_area(stat, position, alpha)

Arguments

aes: aesthetic mapping.

data: the data that you choose to disply in your plot.

x: variable on the x-axis.

fill: color of the inside of the variable.

stat: change on the data for this layer, as a string

position: position adjustment.

alpha: opacity of variables, written as a fraction from 0 to 1.

Examples

library(gapminder)

ggplot(
  data = gapminder, 
  aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)
) +
  geom_area(stat = "bin")

------------------------------------------------
Add alpha to give some opaqueness to be able to see all sets of data clearly.  
  
  
library(gapminder)

ggplot(
  data = gapminder, 
  aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)
) +
  geom_area(stat = "bin", position = "identity", alpha = .3)
