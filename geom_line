# geom_line ()

description: 
#geom_line is a geom function used with ggplot that gives line graphs. It connects observations and is ordered by the x value. 

#usage: ggplot(aes(x, y, color, size)) +
  geom_line()

#arguments: 
aes: aesthetic mapping
x: the variable that is on the x axis
Y: the varibale that is on the y axis
color: color of the line on the graph 
size: the size of the point on the graph 

#example
ggplot(data=California_data, aes(x= year , y = unemployment_rate)) +

We set the x axis to year and the y axis to unemployment rate.
These will be the variables on our line graph.

geom_line(aes(color = "blue" , size = 1)) +

By adding "color = blue", the color of the lines on the graph will now be blue. Then the "size = 1" will make the line thickness size 1.

<- ggplot(data=California_data, aes(x= year , y = unemployment_rate)) +
geom_line(aes(color = "blue" , size = 1)) 

By putting the arrow parameter at the start of the function, the end of the line will have an arrow representing which way the trend is going.
